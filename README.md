# CSS Sorter Desktop Application

This simple app sorts your css properties inside each rule, following one pf the next options:

- Alphabetically
- by length
- by type of property

## By type of property

I have always been tired of all those websites that sort your css alphabetically, obviously some properties must go together, like position and the top, right, bottom and left properties, but there was no software to do so.

This app gives you a sort option that i made manually, which sorts based on a pre-made order.

As per right now, neither prefixed properties nor most at-rules are supported, sorry.

All i can say is: i'm on it.
